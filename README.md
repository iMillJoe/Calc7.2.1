Calc7.2.1
=========

This open source project is an attempt to put the buttons I use most 
on my trusty TI-86 to work on my iPhone with a similar syntax, there are some bugs, 
but you can generally count on the calculator working, and pointing out syntax errors. 

The triangle tab has issues with drawing parts triangles of certain proportions out of view
and I donâ€™t know how to fix that, but your input is welcome. 

Please, have fun with what I have provided.
