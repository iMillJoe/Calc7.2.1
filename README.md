Calc7.2.1
=========

This open source project is an attempt to put the buttons I use most 
on my trusty TI-86 to work on my iPhone with a similar syntax
you can generally count on the calculator tab working, and pointing out syntax errors. 

The triangle tab has issues with drawing parts triangles of certain triangles out of view
and I donâ€™t know how to fix that, but your input is welcome. 

The Circumcircle Calculator seems to work well

Please, have fun with what I have provided.
